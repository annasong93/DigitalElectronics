3 Sensor

Temperature Sensor:
Temperature Sensor is not like the thermometers we use in home. It can sense temperature by voltage. It is all done by the chip inside. The sensor is small and precise. Temperature Sensor can be use to control on off by detection surrounding temperature.

FSR Force Sensitive Resistor:
It is a pressure sensor that can detect squeezing and weight change. The mechanism is change in resistance by the weight it received. It is most used for detecting if one thing received physical squeeze by how much. But it can also be used for determine weight.

Photocells:
It is a light detect sensor. This sensor is very small and easy to carry out but it does have downside that each sensor varies a lot. The difference is up to 50%. So it is not very good to use for a precise measure in light change.

Interesting Arduino Project

Awake
https://www.hackster.io/sofia-aronov/awake-f2cedc

Awake is an interactive arduino project. It makes a painting alive by using conductive ink. I find it interesting that make a painting live and people can interactive with it. Unlike many interactive advertisement in public space which use screen base interactive, this project alows people touch and feel the thing interact with them. It gives people physical feedback which I find is important in interaction. The screen based interaction use kinect sensor but doesn't give audiance the actual touch or feeling of the action. Combine arduino and processing is also the part I feel interested in. It is not only give a feedback to physical touch but use the animation and light project to give audiance different sence in the experience.


# Week 3
## Project 1: Led Bracelet
### IDEA

My idea is to make led light respond to music. It will detect the beat and blink with the beat and change color with it. I want to make it a bracelet as a decoration when people going to music festival. The light will blink with music in order to visualize the music.

*Idealy it can form different shape or motion with the led lightbulbs.

Here is the sketch:

Components and sensor:

1. LED strip or lightbulbs.
2. Sensor: Parallax sound impact sensor

### some other addon ideas
1.Light control LED
Put a light sensor in to detect light. The led on the bracelet only light up when surrounding light is below certain darkness. Otherwise, it won't light up even it hear sounds.
2.Color
Led color is controlled by the vibration sensor. When the sensor detects more vibration the color will vary.
