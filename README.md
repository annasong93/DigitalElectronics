Temperature Sensor
Temperature Sensor is not like the thermometers we use in home. It can sense temperature by voltage. It is all done by the chip inside. The sensor is small and precise. Temperature Sensor can be use to control on off by detection surrounding temperature.

FSR Force Sensitive Resistor
It is a pressure sensor that can detect squeezing and weight change. The mechanism is change in resistance by the weight it received. It is most used for detecting if one thing received physical squeeze by how much. But it can also be used for determine weight.

Photocells
It is a light detect sensor. This sensor is very small and easy to carry out but it does have downside that each sensor varies a lot. The difference is up to 50%. So it is not very good to use for a precise measure in light change.
